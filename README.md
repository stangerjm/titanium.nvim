# Titanium.nvim

TBH it's just really my personal nvim config. I just wanted to be cool and give it a sick name.

## Install

Just clone this repo into ~/.config/nvim or wherever nvim expects to read your config.

```
git clone https://github.com/stangerjm/titanium.nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```

You will need to install NodeJS and some other dependencies:
* `npm install -g typescript typescript-language-server @vue/language-server @vue/typescript-plugin eslint_d vscode-langservers-extracted@4.8.0 neovim`

If you want to use Ruby, you will need to install Ruby and Solargraph.
* https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md#solargraph

If some JavaScript/TypeScript integrations are not working, you may need to set an environment variable. See the Environment Variables section below.

## Environment Variables
Some plugins require a location of plugins installed via NPM. If your global node_modules directory is in `/usr/lib` this config will work fine.
Otherwise just set an environment variable called `GLOBAL_NODE_MODULES` to the path of npm's global node_modules directory.
